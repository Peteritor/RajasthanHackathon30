# RajasthanHackathon30

We have created a platform by which the common mass can lodge their issues and concerns regarding problems that they face. This can be used in Government Organisation as well as private organisations . Every concerned authorised personal is related to a particular department of the government or private organisation. Once the issue is logged in and notified to the respective authority in charge, the issues will be communicated directly to the officials who will be incharge of public relations so that they can solve the issue. A specific deadline will be set for resolving an issue. If the issue is not resolved in the given deadline, it will automatically escalate its seriousness and will be transferred and notified to superiors. By this method more and more people will be able The platform will collect data in well structured manner and analysis can be done to get specific insights that can help the people and the organisation grow. Even Machine learning can be applied to the data to predict the type of issues, probability of solving those issues.
